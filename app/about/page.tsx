              <p className='inline'>Hi there! I&apos;m Julia Boakye-Yiadom, and I truly love working with young children. My teaching journey started six years ago at Rocky Mountain Elementary Pre-K, where I was a teacher&apos;s aide. From there, I gained valuable experience supporting special needs students at Foothill Elementary and then spent time as a substitute teacher in various preschools and daycares around Utah. All of these experiences have prepared me well for my favorite role yet â€“ leading my own preschool, which is now in its second year!</p>
              <br />
              <p>What I find most rewarding about teaching is seeing that spark when a child understands something new and knowing I helped them get there. I really believe in building strong connections with my students so they know I&apos;m their biggest cheerleader and advocate. I hope that helps them feel motivated to learn and grow.</p>
              <p>I&apos;m dedicated to creating a fun and engaging learning environment where children learn through hands-on activities and play. I truly believe this individualized approach helps them thrive. I&apos;m so excited about the possibility of working with your child, and I can&apos;t wait to meet you both!</p>
